Since a person can take on many different roles in the society, it is necessary to further define their more specific properties. For example, if a person is a student, then they will need to be assigned a unique student ID in school. In OOP languages such as Python, this relationship can be represented by defining a new *subclass* of Person, called Student. Conversely, Person is called the *superclass* of Student:\n","\n","    class Student(Person):\n","    \n","This declaration defines Student class to inherit all the attributes and methods from Person class first, and then the subsequent code block after the colon mark either overwrite and modify the methods in the superclass, or further define new methods and attributes.\n","\n","First, Student class overwrites the initialization method of Person class, which is typically a common practice for a subclass. However, part of the aims of the initialization process overlaps with that in the superclass, such as assigning the first name and last name attributes. As a subclass, Student benefits by the fact that a subclass can call its superclass' methods using the keyword **super**. *super().__init__()* instructs Python to call the same function as defined in its superclass. We now see that inheritance passes down relevant methods from superclasses to subclasses.\n","\n","As Student class is a subclass of Person, it is also a different class. Therefore, its *__init__()* needs to be modified. In the example, we added two new attributes:\n","\n","    * student_ID: As its prefix *self* indicates, this is an instance attribute that records a student's unique ID. The student ID is of the string type.\n","    * student_record: This is a class attribute of the dictionary type. Its entries contain two types of data. The first type records under each class year how many students so far have enrolled. For example, (2024, 2) indicates the Class of 2024 has two students. Then the second type records under each unique student ID the first and last name of the student. \n","    \n","We want to make a note here that in the assignment of *student_ID* string, we demonstrated the use of the built-in function *format()*. This is a pretty powerful function that, as its name suggests, converts the first argument into a format specified by the parameter string as the second argument. As the variation of its use cases is too broad, we encourage the reader to refer to Python's online document:\n","\n","    https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=format#format\n","    \n","In the example, though, the parameter string '04d' means converting to an integer format with at least 4 digits. In other words, integer 1 will be converted to a string '0001'. This format fits the typical ID number format in the real world.\n","\n","Finally, we see that the subclass Student further defines a unique method called *year_of_graduation()*. This method is only relevant to those people who are students, and clearly is not general enough to be associated with the superclass Person."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Abstract Methods\n","\n","Abstract methods are those that are declared but not implemented. Abstract methods are useful in creating superclasses where certain methods must be concretely defined in their subclasses.

First, the code defines a base class *Shape* and an **abstract method** *get_area()*. In the base class, *get_area()* is not implemented. Then the Shape class is inherited by two subclasses: *Square* and *Circle*. At the subclass level, when the shape attribute is properly initialized such as the width for Square and the radius for Circle, then *get_area()* is implemented.\n","\n","The fact that in *Shape* class *get_area()* is abstract can be declared in several ways, depending on the programmer's preference:\n","\n","    * Using *raise NotImplementedError*: When a method is abstract, *raise NotImplementedError* will interrupt the program when the method is called.\n","    * Using pass: One can also choose to silently ignore the fact that an abstract method is called, by writing *pass* function as the function body. *pass* function as its name suggests is a special statement in Python, which informs Python that the operation will not generate any results. \n","    * Using *abstract base class* (ABC): There is a special class that can be declared as the superclass of other classes. The *abc* module can be imported, which also contains a decorator called *@abc.abstractmethod*. Using an abstract method decorator is a very powerful statement, in that Python will not allow a class instance to be created if the class contains abstract method decorators. \n","    \n","Finally, the sample code demonstrates another more user-friendly technique to verify during runtime whether a class has implemented its superclass' abstract methods. In Shape class, the code does implement a function called *is_abstract()*. The purpose of the function is to inform a user of the class or its subclasses whether the class contains abstract methods. Since the definition of *get_area()* uses the first approach above, assigning a class object will not return a runtime error. We see from the output result that calling get_area() from a Square object or Circle object will return False, while from a Shape object will return True.\n","\n","This result shows a quite interesting ability of OOP in Python, that a method defined in a superclass can correctly calculate its return even when called from its subclasses. This ability will be credited to the inheritance property of classes. Technically, this is implemented using a special variable self.\\_\\_class\\_\\_. As its name suggests, it returns a reference of the current class name of the object. Thanks to the inheritance property, all subclasses of the superclass Shape will run the same code in *is_abstract()*. But the reference value of self.\\_\\_class\\_\\_ will be only determined during the runtime. This is an effective way to change the behavior of inherited classes in their definitions, without knowing during runtime which variable eventually binds with the classes. \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Special Variables and Methods\n","\n","Above we have seen that *__class__* for a class object is a special variable. We have also seen the use of *__init__()* method that always exists but can be customized by the user. As it turns out, for a Python class, a list of special variables and special methods always get created without user intervention. In this part, we will learn the usage of several important special variables and special methods:\n","\n","    * __file__: Path to the current Python file\n","    * __class__: Reference of the current class name\n","    * __doc__: Docstring record\n","    * __init__(): Class constructor\n","    * __hash__(): Hash function\n","    \n","    \n","All special variables and special methods for Python classes start with two underscores and end with two underscores. However, for those readers where Python is not their first OOP language, one of the most controversial rules in Python is the fact that Python classes have no private or protected attributes or methods, in other words, all attributes and methods are public (meaning they are visible at any place where their objects are defined). In the past examples, we have seen that the code can query and change an attribute of a class quite at will, and Python does not attempt to prevent that under any circumstances.\n","\n","Nevertheless, Python users in the past have created some naming convention that serves to help reminding themselves and other users about the limited scope of some variables. Note that these rules as we will see below are merely recommendations, and they are not enforced by Python system.\n","\n","    * Single underscore _var: Intended for internal use only in class methods.\n","    * Double underscores __var: Intended exclusively for one class but not its subclasses.\n","\n","That being said, Python does apply a trick to double underscore variables. Specifically, Python will protect *__var* to be associated with a single class by **name mangling** the class name before *__var*. In other words, if *__var* is defined within a class, when referenced outside the class definition, its name will be changed to object._CLASSNAME__var. The name mangling will not completely prevent other code to use an internal class variable, but the other code does need to go through the extra trouble to gain access to such internal variables.
