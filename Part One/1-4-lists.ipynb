In the above code block, we introduce a standard procedure to count the elapsed time, using the module function *time.time()*. The function returns a float value in the unit of seconds, which means the fraction part indicates sub-second accuracies. The function retrieves the current computer system clock, and reports a difference with the \"beginning of time\". In modern programming languages such as Python, the beginning of time with respect to modern computer systems is set to January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC). \n","\n","If we have designed an algorithm, when we retrieve *time.time()* before the execution as *tic*, and again after the execution as *toc*, then the difference is the elapsed time. This is a very useful measure of algorithm speed that the reader should learn to use fluently.\n","\n","Next let us talk about how the elapsed time is reported in a *print()* function. Since when we code the printed string format, it is not known to us about the value of elapsed_time. The exact value has to be formatted at runtime (meaning, when the code is actually running by the computer's processor). Python provides two basic ways to combine pre-defined constant string and dynamic argument together at runtime:\n","\n","1. The way inherited from older versions of Python is to use the \"%\" symbol to indicate an argument input to a string, which should be determined at runtime. One example is shown in line 15. In this example \".2f\" means displaying the string argument input as a floating point number with 2 digits after the decimal point.\n","2. The modern way recommended by Python 3 standards is to use a built-in function for any string type variables, as shown in line 23. The built-in function is called *format()*. Python will insert one or more arguments provided in *format()* function and convert them as part of the string as indicated by the reserved symbols {}. In this modern way, the displayed text still can be formatted by user specifications, such as \".2f\" in the example\n","\n","The new concept of owning built-in functions for different variable types is a benefit of so-called object-oriented programming (OOP). We will talk about OOP in the last part of the course, but previously we have noticed that all Python variable types are actually classes. A class in OOP languages contains data *and* methods that directly apply to the data (Note that in OOP, built-in functions in a class are often called **methods** to differentiate with regular functions that are not tightly associated with a class object). In other words, when a programmer creates a class, they not only have prepared a memory storage of the data, but also have prepared a list of functions that are properly coded to process the data. This is one of the benefits of using OOP.\n","\n","In the above sample code, we see that if the variable is a list, it also has a built-in method to perform exactly the task of reversing the list. Thanks to this built-in method, the operation can be coded in just one line built-in method call in line 20.\n","\n","Finally, the difference in algorithm design between the two used methods is that *list.reverse()* method is an \"in-place\" sorting algorithm, while slicing requires doubling the memory space to traverse from the list source.

Hence, their IDs and memory addresses will be different. However, consider the following question: *When two variables represent the same type and same value, are they referencing the same object or different objects in the memory?*\n","\n","The answer to this is not that straightforward. Please carefully review the above updated code block:\n","1. When †wo variables are small immutable integers, Python is smart enough to point the two variables to the same object in the memory. Hence their IDs are identical.\n","2. However, this conclusion cannot be blindly extended to consider large integers and float numbers, because searching for existing integer or float objects costs time. So a software cannot do that for an arbitrary range of integers and float. So in the second and third examples, we see that for two variables of identical large integer value and float value, their IDs are not the same.\n","3. The same argument also applies to the immutable string type. In the two subsequent examples, short strings of the same sequence \"immutable\" are assigned the same ID. However, two strings of the same long sequences are assigned different IDs. \n","4. For the next variation, we consider two mutable list variables of the same value. Since mutable variables can be modified after creation, even if their initial values are assigned to be the same, Python will allocate different IDs and different memory addresses to store the variable values.\n","5. Nevertheless, for all the above situations, there is an approach to force Python to identify two variable names to reference the same object in the memory, that is to assign one variable to be equal to the other, as in the example *b = a*. In such a case, regardless of the mutability type, the two variables will return the same ID number. Furthermore, since the two variables are referencing the same object, it causes the situation that modifying the first mutable variable will be reflected also on the second variable.\n","6. Finally, for mutable variables, we can use a common built-in method *copy()* to tell Python to create two objects but copy the data from one object to the other. In such cases, the two variables will be initially of the same value just like the case above. However, the two objects have different memory addresses, later modifying one variable will not affect the object referenced by the second variable.\n","\n","The reader may wonder what ultimately let a Python programming software to determine when to identify two objects of the same value in the memory. We caution that except in the case of explicitly identifying two variables as in the example of *b = a*, practitioners should not assume that two objects of the same value are identical in memory. The choice of doing so is entirely for implementation optimization considerations, and it is up to the software designer to decide. In other words, if we want two variables to be identical, we should explicitly proclaim *b = a*. In other cases we should not imply in any way that two variables are the same object."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Summary\n","\n","* A list type variable stores an ordered sequence of variables, whose types can be different.\n","* A list element can be addressed by using a pair of square brackets: l[index].
