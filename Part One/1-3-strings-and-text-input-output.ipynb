First, we can assume a string variable such as *a* in the example not only represents the entire string, but when in addressing string elements, it also indicates the memory address of the first element. Then any additional offsets from the beginning of the string are described within a pair of square brackets.\n","1. *a[0]* retrieves from the first string character plus zero offset, which represents the first character \"H\".\n","2. *a[1:2]* uses a colon to indicate retrieving a segment of the string characters. The left argument is called **begin**, and the right argument is called **end**. The following rule is somewhat special to Python, if the reader is familiar with other languages, that the string segment retrieved by [begin: end] will include the character at a[begin] position (if valid) but will exclude the character at a[end] position. For the print out of the second example is starting from a[1] = \"e\" but will exclude a[2] = \"l\".\n","3. If the brackets contain three numbers separated by two colons, then the third number is called the **step size**. Hence, the retrieved characters starting at a[0], stopping before a[6], and with step size 2 are a[0]=\"H\", a[2]=\"l\", and a[4]=\"o\".\n","4. The string character addresses can also be counted backwards from the last character. In Python, the last character of *a* is denoted as *a[-1]*.\n","5. Similarly, the same rule to retrieve a segment of a string applies when the offsets are given in negative numbers.

Looking at the slicing code, there are two key points to remember:\n","1. The last character is referenced using the negative offset value of -1. If we count the offset positively, this value should be *len(input_string)-1*. Because the string character offset starts from zero, so the length of the string actually points to an offset that is one character beyond the range of the string.\n","2. However, since Python dictates that the slicing will stop before the ending offset, so using the smallest non-negative value zero will not be able to retrieve the first character \"P\" in reverse order. Note we also cannot use values smaller than zero, because as we pointed out above, -1 actually refers to the last character of the string.\n","\n","So the proper way to reverse a string using slicing operation is to keep the -1 step size, but ignore the exact values for *begin* and *end*. In the second algorithm, neither *begin* nor *end* indexes is provided. In such a case, Python will automatically retrieve the longest possible string result.

First, we see for the first time in this course, the use of comments in Python code. A comment space is denoted by two ways: 1. Using a pair of triple quotation marks directly in the source code (instead of within the print statement). A pair of triple quotation marks will claim everything in between them as comments, which may cover multiple lines. 2. In comparison, using the hash symbol (or being called the pound sign in the US) \"#\" designates immediately after it till the remainder of the same line as comments. When encountering comments, Python will simply ignore them.\n","\n","The purpose of including comments is to increase the readability for the benefits of both the author and equally importantly other readers. If the author of a program did not leave sufficient comments about the logic of the code and the purpose of individual variables, it would be difficult for other readers to second-guess the author's logic and it compromises the reusability of the code.\n","\n","Therefore, in modern software engineering, practitioners should pay equal attention to both the logic of their code and explaining it using sufficient comments.

In this course, we strongly recommend our students to start cultivate this practice.\n","\n","In lines 2 and 3, the code imports two modules: math and random. Importing math is to be able to use the *floor()* and *ceil()* functions. Importing random serves another purpose, that we will use a randomized integer generator called *randint()* to generate random arithmetic challenges so that every time the program is executed the challenge can be different.\n","\n","In lines 9 to 11, three random integer numbers are generated. *random_operator* assumes the value of 1 or 2 as the output from the function *random.randint(1, 2)*; *random_A* is the random numerator between the values -10 and 10; *random_B* is the random denominator between the values 1 and 10.\n","\n","In lines 12 to 17, we see for the first time the use of flow control statements: *if -- else --*. We will discuss flow control statements later in this course.
