To define a function, the code shall start with a keyword *def*, followed by the name of the function provided by the programmer. \n\nA function also may or may not have a list of input arguments. In the first function, since the purpose of the function is always to print \"Hello World!\", no additional input is needed. The use of a pair of empty parentheses indicates that the function has no input argument.\n\nIn the second example, *print_string()* codes a print function, but its function code does not specify what is the message to be printed. Instead, the function uses the input argument *s*. When the function is called, the function call must specify the input argument value. This value then will be assigned to variable *s*.\n\nThere is one more common component in both *print_hello_world()* and *print_string()*, that is the inclusion of a comment section right next to the definition of function name and its input arguments, namely, right after the colon mark. The comment section is required to use the triple quotation marks, and they can be either single or double quotation marks. There is a name for the comment created as such, called *docstring*. \n\nDifferent from other types of code comments, the use of docstrings is strongly recommended. Developers can use docstrings to document the main design goal and logic of the function and a list of input/output arguments. Docstrings help third-party users to better interface with the functions without going through the detailed coding implementation.\n\nThe content of docstrings will be also assigned as a built-in attribute of the functions or methods that include docstrings, called *.__doc__*. In the above example, the function's docstring can be printed out by: *print(print_string.__doc__)*\n\nTo emphasize its generality, built-in Python functions and methods also include docstrings extensively. For example, below let us review the docstring of Python's own *print()* function:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(print.__doc__)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-25T17:09:25.217461Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-25T17:09:25.217804Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-25T17:09:25.221886Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-25T17:09:25.217771Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-25T17:09:25.221225Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"print(value, ..., sep=' ', end='\\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)\n\nPrints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.\nOptional keyword arguments:\nfile:  a file-like object (stream); defaults to the current sys.stdout.\nsep:   string inserted between values, default a space.\nend:   string appended after the last value, default a newline.\nflush: whether to forcibly flush the stream.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Function Arguments\n\nIn the previous example, we have seen a user-defined function may include a list of arguments.

When a function includes a list of arguments, it is allowed that the code also declare a default value when no value is provided when the function is called in the code. The first line of printed results indicates this case, when *L, S = func_test()* does not provide the argument values, and the default values of *L = ['a', 'b']* and *S = 'ab'* are used. \n2. It may come as a surprise that while the same function is called the second time in the same fashion, the returned values of *L* and *S* are different from the first time. This is because an important rule defined in Python regarding the type of an input argument to be mutable or immutable:\n    * When an argument type is immutable, then its default value will be reset to the one listed in the function definition. In the above example, *S = 'ab'* is immutable string type. Therefore, when its input value is not provided by the function call, the default value is always used.\n    * When an argument type is mutable, then its default value will be set only once based on the value in the function definition. Subsequently, the default value of a mutable argument remains the same from the last time the function is called. In the above example, when the function is first called, the mutable argument *L* has changed its value to ['a', 'b', 'c']. Therefore, when the function is called the second time without explicit setting the argument value, the default value of *L* is the same value from the last function call. Adding another 'c' to this value will return the result ['a', 'b', 'c', 'c'].\n   * The third line of printed result illustrates the situation that when a mutable argument is changed inside a function, the modified value is carried over to the outside of the function regardless if the value is part of the function output. However, when an immutable argument is modified inside a function, it is not carried over to change the variable value outside the function. This conclusion makes sense because when the function executes the statement *S = S + 'c'*, the assigned new string *S* is a local string object that has different memory address and ID than the string *S* of the same name outside the function. \n   \n   \nIn conclusion, when arguments are passed into a function, mutable variables share the same objects inside and outside the function, while immutable variables do not share the same objects. As a result, changes on immutable variables inside a function do not change the variables of the same names outside. Such immutable variables inside a function are called local variables.\n\nContrast to local variables, Python also defines a keyword called *global* to define global variables. When a variable is declared as global, then Python will force all variables of the same name to share the same object and memory address. Consequently, changing the value of a global variable in one place will affect all the other places in the code when the same variable is used.
