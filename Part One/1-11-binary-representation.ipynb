In the first level course of this series, we have learned the basic programming skill on Python. In our journey so far, we have encountered several basic Python variable types, including integers, floats, boolean, string, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. I will assume in this course, you have fluently mastered the basic skills of coding Python programs using these variables. You are encouraged to refresh your memory about these topics from the lecture notes and videos of the first course.\n","\n","In this first lecture of the second course, we will discuss how these basic variable types are stored in computer memory.\n","\n","# Integers\n","\n","In Python since version 3, an *int* variable is capable of storing arbitrarily large integer values in magnitude. This affects how the integer values are stored in the computer memory.\n","\n","To understand the fundamental data structures of Python integer variables, we first need to understand that modern computers store data and programs only in binary form with two distict values of 0 and 1. Since the modern processors commonly known as central processing units (CPU) all use digital transistors as the basic building block, the transistors can conveniently using two discrete voltage values, namely, low and high, to represent two binary digits 0 and 1. In the computer literature, one digit of 0 or 1 value is called one bit; 8 bits together is called a byte. For example, a modern computer and its operating system is called a 64-bit system because its processor in one step can calculate fundamental operators such as addition or multiplication of one to two numbers represented by 64-bits.\n","\n","In this lecture, we will not dive deeper to practice arithmetic calculations in binary format. Below, we use the basic 8-bit binary representation to just show some examples:\n","\n","    * integer 0 is represented by eight 0's: (00000000).\n","    * integer 1 is represented by: (00000001). A one at the lowest digit represents the same value one in base-10 system.\n","    * integer 2 is represented by: (00000010). Notice that each binary digit only holds two possible values, when value 2 is larger than 1, its binary representation will be forced to use one digit higher to represent (00000001) + (00000001) = (00000010).\n","    * integer 3 is represented by: (00000011). The representation shows the fact that 3 in base-10 representation is equal to (00000010) + (00000001) = (00000011).\n","    \n","In Python beyond version 3, an integer variable is allowed to use an unlimited number of bytes to store integers, as long as the computer has the space to allocate valid memory addresses to store the bytes. As a result, this implementation supports storing very large integers in *int* variables.\n","\n","To verify the fact, we use a useful Python function called *sys.getsizeof()*. In the sample code below, we see that the smallest number of bytes (again, 1 byte is 8 bits) to store any integer value is 28. The reader may wonder why the smallest number of bytes is not one byte or any other number much smaller than 28. The reason is that Python is an OOP language, as such, any variable type is in fact a *class* data structure. Therefore, there are fixed overhead data structure to define the properties of a class object in addition to storing just its data value. \n","\n","As we increase the integer value to a fairly large value, such as *i3* in the sample code, then Python would need to increate the number of bytes in the memory."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-15T07:13:47.431898Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-15T07:13:47.431494Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-15T07:13:47.438784Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-15T07:13:47.437755Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-15T07:13:47.431816Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Byte count:  28 28\n","Byte count:  36\n"]}],"source":["import sys\n","\n","i1 = 2022\n","i2 = 1\n","print('Byte count: ', sys.getsizeof(i1), sys.getsizeof(i2))\n","\n","i3 = 314159265358979323846\n","print('Byte count: ', sys.getsizeof(i3))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Finally, let us talk about storing positive integers and negative integers in Python. If our readers are familiar with C or C++ language, they would know that an integer can be declared as signed integer or unsigned integer. A signed integer as its name suggests differentiates an integer value to be either positive or negative, while an unsigned integer does not represent negative numbers. \n","\n","To illutrate how the sign of a number affects its data representation in the memory, let us again borrow the 8-bit binary representation as an example. If we represent only positive integers (or more precies, nonnegative integers) using 8 bits, then the smallest integer is 0 or (00000000) and the largest integer is 255 or (11111111). More specifically,\n","\n","    255 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = (00000001) + (00000010) + (00000100) + (00001000) + (00010000) + (00100000) + (01000000) + (10000000)\n","    \n","Now let us consider using 8 bits to represent both positive and negative integers, then we need to take over at least one bit to represent the + and - sign. Therefore, there are only 7 bits left to store the magnitude of the integer value. As a result, the range of the signed integers in 8-bit representation is between +127 and -128.\n","\n","The above is the situation if a programming language supports both signed and unsigned integer type. Nevertheless, in Python, there is no unsigned integer type. Since integers can be arbitrarily large only constrained by the available computer memory, there is very little reason to create unsigned integer type by avoiding storing the sign digit. \n","\n","In the sample code below, we use the same function *sys.getsizeof()* to calculate the byte number when storing *i1* and *i3* with the negative sign.

In *s3*, the increase in byte count is 3*2 = 6. This means a Python string always use the same byte count to encode every character.

From *b2* to *b3*, 3 bytes are added to encode the Chinese character \"二“. The tradeoff using the UTF-8 standard is that it returns a shorter byte array than the Unicode standard, but since each character is variable byte length, calculating the memory address of a character in the middle of a string would need to traverse and count the accumulated byte counts of every character before it, which significantly increases the time complexity."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-15T08:25:33.395478Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-15T08:25:33.394606Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-15T08:25:33.405296Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-15T08:25:33.402989Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-15T08:25:33.395426Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["<class 'bytes'>\n","Byte counts:  36 37 40 41\n"]}],"source":["b1 = \"二\".encode('utf-8')\n","b2 = \"二0\".encode('utf-8')\n","b3 = \"二0二\".encode('utf-8')\n","b4 = \"二0二0\".encode('utf-8')\n","\n","print(type(b1))\n","print('Byte counts: ', sys.getsizeof(b1), sys.getsizeof(b2), sys.getsizeof(b3), sys.getsizeof(b4))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["To convert a *bytes* type to the standard *str* type, one can use another function in reverse of the *.encode()* method, called *.decode()*.

More surprisingly, we can recall from the above string examples that the byte count for a list [\"二\", 0] is 88. It seems counter-intuitive that adding a list element [\"二\", 0] only increases byte count by 8 from 88 to 96.\n","\n","To resolve this dilemma, we have to understand how the list elements are stored and referenced in Python. The hint is to recall that list is a mutable type, meaning, modifying the element values in a list does not change its memory address and ID. This means what is included in the list's byte counts are only references to separate element objects of their own memory addresses. Since storing memory references only costs constant space of 8 bytes (i.e., 64 bits in a 64-bit OS), the *sys.getsizeof()* function can only count the bytes for the memory allocation of these reference pointers.\n","\n","If one wants to calculate precisely the total memory size of the whole list data, we should use the following approach:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["import sys\n","l2 = [\"二\", 0]\n","\n","byte_count = sys.getsizeof(l2) + sys.getsizeof(l2[0]) + sys.getsizeof(l2[1])\n","print(byte_count)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Next, since all the element references are organized as an ordered sequence, we consider the time complexity to add or remove elements from this ordered sequence."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["trial_count = 1000\n","\n","import time\n","\n","# Test remove the last elements\n","test_list = list('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ')*1000000\n","tic = time.time()\n","for i in range(trial_count):\n","    test_list.pop(-1)\n","elapsed_time = time.time() - tic\n","print('Total time removing last elements: ', elapsed_time)\n","\n","# Test remove the first elements\n","test_list = list('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ')*1000000\n","tic = time.time()\n","for i in range(trial_count):\n","    test_list.pop(0)\n","elapsed_time = time.time() - tic\n","print('Total time removing first elements: ',elapsed_time)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["When we run the above sample code, we will see the dramatic difference in the time complexity, where the first operation to remove the last element of a list repeating 1,000 times only costs less than 0.001 second, but the second operation to remove the first element of a list repeating 1,000 times costs more than 26 seconds on Kaggle's online Jupyter Notebook. This dramatic difference in cost of time and therefore computer resources is caused by the fact that the list type simply stores its element references as an ordered sequence. Consider the following two situations:\n","\n","* When the last element of a sequence is removed, the length of the sequence is simply reduced by one, and there is no other operations necessary to maintain values for the rest of the elements in the list.\n","* When the first element of a sequence is removed, to maintain the order of the sequence except removing the first element, Python actually iteratively moves the (i+1)-th element reference to overwrite the i-th element reference. As a result, when our test list is long such as in the above example, this operation of shifting all elements to the left by one actually is very expensive even in modern computer's standard. \n","    \n","The above complexity analysis about the *pop()* operation also applies to the *insert()* operation.
